# Metacritic Data Analysis Project

### Showcasing my proficiency with Python

This file contains the code I used to scrape data from Metacritic, as well as the steps taken to manipulate and clean that information within a Pandas dataframe.

I also used some data from VGChartz.com, credit to https://github.com/MikeGillotti/vgchartz-data whose webscraper I used to gather some info from this website. 
Since my project was primarily focused on Metacritic, I used their webscraper rather than building my own.
